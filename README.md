Raylib 3D experiments:
- Shadowmaps
- Instancing of both transforms and UVs for planes that represent 3D characters
- I have made a custom draw_mesh_instanced based on DrawMeshInstanced in raylib
- First person camera with gravity + basic physics

Based on:
- My Odin + Raylib + Hot Reload template: https://github.com/karl-zylinski/odin-raylib-hot-reload-game-template
- Raylib 3D basic lighting example: https://www.raylib.com/examples/shaders/loader.html?name=shaders_basic_lighting (no shadows or instancing, just phong shading)
- Raylib 3D shadowmap example: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/examples/shaders/shaders_shadowmap.c
- Raylib 3D instancing example: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/examples/shaders/shaders_mesh_instancing.c
